How to setup:
1. COPY app/config/core.private.php.default to app/config/core.private.php
2. Edit the file to your likings. This includes a new Security.salt & Security.cipherSeed
3. COPY app/config/database.php.default to app/config/database.php
4. Modify your copied file to reflect your database details.

NOTE: If all the outside page resources like css and images fail to display, make sure you have mod_rewrite loaded into Apache. Please also make sure that you do not delete the *.default files as these are tracked by subversion. Copy their contents into the normal file name. Do not rename.
