If you want a development install COPY (do NOT rename or move) app/config/core.dev.php to app/config/core.private.php.
2. Edit the new file to your likings. This includes a new Security.salt & Security.cipherSeed
3. COPY app/config/database.php.default to app/config/database.php
4. Modify your copied file to reflect your database details.

NOTE: If all the outside page resources like css and images fail to display, make sure you have mod_rewrite loaded into Apache. Please also make sure that you do not delete/rename/move the *.default files as these are tracked by Subversion. Copy their contents into the normal file name.
