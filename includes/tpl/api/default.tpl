<strong>Managing XML-API</strong><br />
Here you can manage the XML-API interface for TheHostingTool. This allows you to
connect a client to your THT installation so it can perform tasks remotely
instead of interacting on a database level. TheHostingTool (official) client app
will use this API to connect.
