<strong>API Key</strong><br />
Here is your <strong>unique</strong> API Key. Do not share this with anyone.
It's like a password. The client will need to have this key in order for it to
talk with THT. If you ever decide to generate a new key, anything using the old
key will become unusable unless you give it your new key.
